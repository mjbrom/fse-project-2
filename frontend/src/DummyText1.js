Response to Help (Donors) 
Fortunately,  there  are  very  many  good  Samaritans  who  are  keen  to  help  but 
they  may  not  know  what  is  required  and  where  such  help  needs  to  be  
delivered.  Both coordination and automation are required for the success of the 
relief and rescue efforts. A response can be of two types: 
a)  Anyone can search a request database and respond to it. The response may 
be  towards  one  or  more  items  in  a  request.  A  response  will  be  towards  a  
request. 
b)  A  response  to  help  may  be  proactively  made  (even  before  a  disaster  has  
occurred  or  a request  is  created)  but  delivered  against  a  real  event.  This  is  
known as a pledge. We certainly need a virtual agent or admin human that 
connects Donors, Recipients, the volunteers, and government agencies.  
c) Our  goal  is  to  have  the  request-response  matched  automatically  as  
much as possible using the proximity of locations, to have an 
automated relief management. Admin users should be able to override this 
match. 
d)  Admin users should be able to query and match the request with a response 
and  notify  the  donor  /  recipient  for  direct  delivery.  There  is  no  storage 
capacity with this system.  
e)  Actual mechanism of fulfillment (shipment and delivery) is external to this tool `
