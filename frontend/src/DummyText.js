const dummyText = `People who are exposed to such nature’s fury need help.  Help is required in the 
form of human rescuers, money, and materials.  Various categories of items like 
food,  clothing  shelter,  medicines,  medical  attention,  and  common  day-to-day 
consumables  are  required.    The  need  for  volunteers  who  can  be  on  the  field  is 
very  critical.  Transport  on  land,  water,  and  air  is  required.  Such  events needing 
help may occur simultaneously at multiple locations. Optimized use of available 
resources  is  a  critical  success  factor.    Anyone  can  request  help.  A  request  
for Help may have one or more components (Human resources, money, 
material)  in  it.  The  requestor  or  the  relief  center  person  can  expire  individual 
request items or the entire request. If a request has been fulfilled it is so marked. 
Both fulfilled and expired items can’t be delivered. There are many categories of 
items  and  categories  of  help  that  may  be  required,  and  it  does  become  a  
challenge to collect, process, deliver and manage such requests. `
